<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
    My name is Jeongyeon Kim.
    <br />
    I was born in 1998 at Seoul, South Korea.
    I am a curious graduate student eager to study python for my own purpose, which is "quantitative funding."<br />
    I graduated Sookmyung Girls' Highschool in Seoul, South Korea.
    I was selected as one of the 18th Korea-Japan Joint Government Scholarship Receiver from January 2017 to March 2022.
    I graduated Electrical, Electronics, and Information Engineering Department of Nagoya University in Japan.
    I entered the graduate school of Electrical Engineering (EE) of Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in August 2022.
    However, I transferred my major to Business and Technology Management (BTM) in August 2023.
    Now fully enjoying my study, I am eager to develop myself as an aggressive creator who develops its own new world.
